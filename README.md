Milk heat treatments_FT-IR


## Abstract

#### Thermal treatments induce variable physical and chemical modifications in milk molecules, which determine the quality of dairy products. Discrimination of the samples involved in different degrees of heat treatment can be used to direct further ingredient formulations and target products. An approach was developed to discriminate the degree of heat treatment applied to milk using an infrared absorption profile coupled with chemometric measurements.
